# Project Summary

## What Was Created

A complete Foundry-based Solidity project for a Secret Santa-style meme coin lottery game on Base network.

## Files Created

1. **src/FriendsMemePool.sol** - Main smart contract (450+ lines)
   - Hidden assignments until deadline
   - Uniswap V3 integration for swaps and price oracles
   - Winner bonus system (10% of pool)
   - Leaderboard functionality
   - Complete game lifecycle management

2. **script/Deploy.s.sol** - Deployment script
   - Simple one-command deployment
   - Works with Foundry's scripting system

3. **test/FriendsMemePool.t.sol** - Test suite
   - 5 comprehensive tests
   - All tests passing
   - Tests core functionality

4. **README.md** - Main documentation
   - Complete setup instructions
   - Usage examples with cast commands
   - Feature explanations
   - Deployment guide

5. **DEPLOYMENT_GUIDE.md** - Step-by-step deployment
   - Detailed walkthrough
   - All cast commands included
   - Troubleshooting section

6. **foundry.toml** - Foundry configuration
   - Configured for Base network
   - Etherscan verification setup
   - Solidity 0.8.20

7. **.env.example** - Environment template
   - Shows required variables
   - Ready to copy and configure

8. **.gitignore** - Git ignore file
   - Protects .env secrets
   - Ignores build artifacts

## Key Features Implemented

1. **Hidden Assignments**
   - Assignments invisible until join deadline
   - `getAssignments()` reverts before deadline
   - Creates suspense during joining phase

2. **Winner Bonus System**
   - Top performer gets 10% of total pool
   - Based on % gain from entry to unlock price
   - Automatically distributed on claim

3. **Leaderboard**
   - Sorted by performance (% gain)
   - Shows all participants
   - Real-time after winner declaration

4. **Price Tracking**
   - Records entry price at swap time
   - Fetches unlock price from Uniswap V3
   - Calculates % performance automatically

5. **Uniswap V3 Integration**
   - Swaps ETH for meme tokens via Uniswap Router
   - Gets prices from Uniswap V3 pool oracles
   - Uses Base network addresses

6. **Security**
   - ReentrancyGuard on critical functions
   - Whitelist-based access control
   - Safe token transfers

## Quick Start Commands

```bash
# Install dependencies
forge install

# Build
forge build

# Test
forge test

# Deploy to Base Sepolia testnet
cp .env.example .env
# Edit .env with your keys
forge script script/Deploy.s.sol:DeployScript --rpc-url base_sepolia --broadcast

# Deploy to Base mainnet
forge script script/Deploy.s.sol:DeployScript --rpc-url base --broadcast --verify
```

## Technical Stack

- **Solidity**: 0.8.20
- **Framework**: Foundry (Forge, Cast)
- **Network**: Base (Mainnet & Sepolia)
- **DEX**: Uniswap V3
- **Dependencies**: OpenZeppelin Contracts

## Contract Size & Gas

- Contract compiles successfully with warnings (style suggestions only)
- No critical errors
- All tests pass
- Ready for deployment

## Next Steps for You

1. Get Base Sepolia ETH for testing
2. Get BaseScan API key for verification
3. Find meme token addresses you want to use
4. Find their Uniswap V3 pool addresses
5. Deploy to testnet first
6. Test with friends
7. Deploy to mainnet when ready

## Important Notes

- Time parameters use "hours * 100" format (e.g., 168 = 7 days)
- Entry amount in wei (use `cast` to convert)
- Need actual Uniswap V3 pool addresses on Base
- Winner bonus is 10% (hardcoded in contract)

## Support

All documentation is in:
- [README.md](README.md) - Main docs
- [DEPLOYMENT_GUIDE.md](DEPLOYMENT_GUIDE.md) - Deployment walkthrough
- Contract comments in [src/FriendsMemePool.sol](src/FriendsMemePool.sol)

Good luck with your Secret Santa meme lottery! ðŸŽ°ðŸš€
